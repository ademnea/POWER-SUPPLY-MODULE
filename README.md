# POWER-SUPPLY-MODULE
2 of the PCBs will; charge Li batteries using Power and also Power and Solar respectively. The 3rd board will simply distribute power at the Beehive. 
The design is made to charge Lithium Ion batteries - strictly. 
For power distribution, we supply 3Amps which is enough for a Raspberry Pi. 
These two boards are made independent of each other.
For the part that has both mains and solar, one may choose to enable solar by soldering jumper pads 2 and 3. For mains, jumper pad 1.
The distribution board is made to supply both 3.3v and 5v respectively.
